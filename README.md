Hypervisor-based debugger

What is this:
This is a first super early alpha release. So, there are some limitations in current implementation:
- Visible breakpoints: breakpoint patches are visible to the debuggee
- Not too optimized: it's about architecture, the compiler optimizations are on (Maximize speed) and verified for correctness
